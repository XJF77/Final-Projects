Description
My project is a text-based RPG inspired by the Shin Megami Tensei Persona franchise. It aims to deliver an immersive narrative experience, featuring side quests for added depth. The project will also include a tactful battle system, requiring strategic planning and resource management.

Features
Immersive narrative 
Inclusion of side quests for additional depth and exploration.
Tactful battle system emphasizing strategic planning and resource management.

Challenges
Text Parsing and Display: Implementing a system to parse and display text-based dialogue and narrative elements in a visually appealing and readable format.

Data Management: Developing a system to manage game data such as character attributes, inventory items, quest progress, and game states in an organized and efficient manner.

Battle System Logic: Designing and implementing the logic for the tactful battle system, including turn-based mechanics, enemy AI, skill effects, and player actions.

Randomization: Incorporating randomness into the game mechanics, such as generating random encounters, loot drops, and enemy behavior, to add variety and replayability.

User Input Handling: Creating a robust system to handle user input, including menu navigation, dialogue choices, and battle commands, while ensuring input validation and error handling.

Code Structure and Modularity: Structuring the codebase in a modular and maintainable way to facilitate future updates, expansions, and bug fixes as the project evolves.

Optimization: Optimizing code performance and memory usage to ensure smooth gameplay and minimize load times, especially on resource-constrained devices or platforms.


Outcomes
Ideal Outcome: Deliver a captivating text-based RPG experience that captures the essence of the Persona franchise while introducing fresh gameplay elements.
Minimal Viable Outcome: Create a functional text-based RPG with basic narrative and battle mechanics.
