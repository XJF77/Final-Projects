Project Proposal: Azeroth's Heroes: The Quest Against Pyrothor


Objective:
Create a text based rpg, where player stats and strartegy are the main gameplay loop. ALong woth a level up system and story driven plot elements.

Game Features:

Choose Your Class: Players can select from three distinct classes: Mage, Fighter, or Rogue, each with its own unique strengths. This feature corresponds to the choose_class() function in the code.

Dynamic Combat System: Engage in strategic turn-based combat against a variety of enemies. Utilize a combination of attacksand items to overcome your foes and emerge victorious. This feature aligns with the combat_round() function.

Explore Diverse Locations: Embark on a perilous journey through a series of atmospheric locations, each offering different challenges, enemies, and rewards. This feature corresponds to the explore_location() function.

 Boss Battles: Test your skills against powerful boss enemies, including the Elder Treant, Arcane Golem, Lich King Mal'Gorath, and Pyrothor himself. These epic encounters require careful planning and strategy to emerge victorious and are managed by the encounter_boss() function.

Upgrade Your Hero: Earn experience points, level up your character, and acquire new weapons, armor, and magical artifacts to enhance your abilities and customize your playstyle. This feature is facilitated by the level_up() function and visiting shops to purchase equipment.

Challenges:

Learning more about game design principles, including balancing gameplay mechanics and creating engaging user experiences.
Researching efficient algorithms for managing game state, combat mechanics, and procedural content generation.
Exploring methods for optimizing performance and handling potential scalability issues as the game evolves.

Outcomes:
Ideal Outcome: The ideal outcome for this project would be to deliver a polished, immersive gaming experience that captivates players with its rich narrative, engaging gameplay mechanics, and vibrant fantasy world. Additionally, achieving a positive reception from players and possibly gaining recognition within the gaming community would be a significant success.

Minimal Viable Outcome: 
The minimum viable outcome of this project would be to create a playable prototype of the game featuring at least one fully functional character class, a basic combat system, and a few interconnected locations to explore. While it may lack some advanced features and content, this prototype should still demonstrate the core mechanics and provide an enjoyable experience for players.
Milestones:

Week 1: Plan out gameplay loop
Week 2: Implement core gameplay mechanics, including character classes, basic combat system, and character progression. Create placeholder assets and design initial levels for testing.
Week 3: Integrate additional features stats, level up system and weapon stat adjustments
